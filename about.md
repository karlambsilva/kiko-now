<!-- Hello! Let me introduce myself . . .  -->
Hello! üëãüèª

I am Karla Silva, an experienced Software Test Engineer from the northeast region of Brazil with more than seven years of experience in the software industry.

<!-- üë©üèª‚Äçüíª -->

##### Work Experience and Education

Currently, I work at [CESAR](http://english.cesar.org.br/), which is a private innovation institute with headquarters in Recife, and I've experienced different configurations of teams, but all of them plugged into an Agile environment. Also, I'm passionate about being the customer's advocate and how the agile testing mindset can contribute to the development of the best possible system.

Regarding testing strategy, types, and levels of testing, I've worked with exploratory, performance, API, and E2E (end to end) tests with different programming languages; for instance, Java, PHP, and Javascript. 

My educational background starts with my bachelor's degree in Computer Information Systems from [Federal University of Pernambuco](https://www.ufpe.br/inicio). Coupled with, I also have a master's degree in Computer Science which dissertation was applied research about incomplete requirements in the software industry.


##### Personal life

Besides the technology sphere, I could summarize my life with the following items: believing in the Bible and Jesus Christ, traveling around the world (especially to natural places) with friends and family, studying and learning new things, and being passionate about dessert, dogs, animation movies, and Korean dramas.

### What I will write about in this blog?

As I mentioned before, I love to read, study, and experiment with new things, so I promise to share with you concepts related to software testing that I'm reviewing or learning at the moment. Additionally, posts might include my impressions about frameworks and tools, overviews of conferences/courses/podcasts related to testing.
